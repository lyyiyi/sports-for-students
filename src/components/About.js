      <h1>The Story.</h1>
      <p>This student association was founded to promote social engagement through sports. We do not take ourselves too seriously, yet we are here to engage, improve and learn together.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to create a welcoming environment where students can connect, share experiences, and grow both personally and athletically.</p>
      <p>We believe that sports can be a powerful tool for building friendships and fostering a sense of community.</p>
      <p>Join us in our mission to make sports accessible and enjoyable for all students.</p>
